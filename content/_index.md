I'm currently studying for an [MSc Artificial Intelligence](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/courses/pg/mai/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Previously I studied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/). I am interested in building safe and trustworthy AI systems that can solve meaningful problems.
