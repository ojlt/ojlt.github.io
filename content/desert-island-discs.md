I absolutely love listening to the popular radio program "Desert Island Discs". The concept is simple: if you were on a desert island, which 8 pieces of music (that can fit on a single "disc") would you take? My current selection, in no particular order, are the following:

- **Sibelius** - [Symphony 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mafCgCUjtLs). For me the most "perfect" orchestral work ever composed. Still waiting to hear this one live. Could [this moment](https://youtu.be/mafCgCUjtLs?t=305) be the best cadence in music? 
- **Stravinsky** - [Apollo Musag√®te](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys9xmuPH1eg). An underrated work by Stravinsky. If all you know is the Rite of Spring, the [final movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Qdu0RImRw) might shock you. 
- **Stravinsky** - [Oedipus Rex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEO2Iq5KTXo&t=2787s). Stravinsky with his genius in full display. A work like no other. Particularly a fan of this [moment](https://youtu.be/TEO2Iq5KTXo?t=2787). Music from hell!
- **Beethoven** - [Eroica Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdYCHwtn2Bc&t=2750s&pp=ygUPZXJvaWNhIHN5bXBob255). Music I could listen to on repeat forever. Incredible memories of playing it with my university orchestra. This [passage](https://youtu.be/KdYCHwtn2Bc?t=2750) reduces me to tears every time. 
- **Ravel** - [Le Tombeau de Couperin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMLd3DqMwA). I originally thought about replacing with Gaspard de la Nuit, but this work seems more personal. 
- **Bartok** - [String Quartet 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2zPA4RuzaM). My favourite string quartet. Lucky enough to hear it live played by the Takacs Quartet. 
- **Mahler** - [Symphony 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9_fYU42ZJY&pp=ygUSbWFobGVyIDkga2xlbXBlcmVy). Need I say more? That [last movement...](https://youtu.be/tkChdHBuoiQ?t=3585)
- **Beethoven** - [Piano Sonata 32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ6B9CW0Veo). My favourite piece for the piano. Very difficult to play right. How are your [trills?](https://youtu.be/YE2iyBRmA_g?t=1652)

As for my item and book, I'd probably take pen/paper and Nabokov's *Speak, memory*.
